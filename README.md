# PSX Completion Tracker

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is something that I built to test/expand my React knowledge, and is intended to interact with psx-completion-server, which is a nodeJS backend that uses MongoDB to store the data for the project, and includes a very simple API to pull and push data to the database.

I have a grand goal to beat every PSX game ever released - the list here is not complete, but it's nearly everything, and I wanted a way to keep track of what I have beaten and not beaten.
